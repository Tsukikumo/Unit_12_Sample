# Unit-12-Carly

Begin by importing or copying your code from Chapter 11 for Carly.

- You will only be updating your StaffDinnerEventDemo.java file (possibly other demo classes if you made it a subclass)
  - Modify the demo class (and parent classes, if applicable) to be immune to user data entry errors by handling exceptions (try-catch) for non-String user input.
  - Each time the program requires a non-String input from the user (ex: number of guests, menu options, salaries), continuously prompt the user until the data entered is the correct type
